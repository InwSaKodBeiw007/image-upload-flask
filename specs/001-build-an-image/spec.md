# Feature Specification: Image Upload Web Service

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-image`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an image upload web service that receives photos captured from Python/OpenCV applications and displays them through a web interface. Core requirements: - Accept HTTP POST requests from Python clients using CV2/OpenCV library - Store uploaded images in organized server folders with unique filenames - Save image metadata to database (filename, upload timestamp, file path, file size, image dimensions) - Generate accessible URLs for each uploaded image that can be shared - Support common image formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, WEBP Web interface features: - Display uploaded images in a responsive gallery/grid layout - Show metadata: upload time, filename, file size - Provide direct links to view and download individual images - Sort images by upload date (newest first) - Simple, clean UI with mobile support Technical requirements: - Handle concurrent uploads from multiple Python clients - Ensure unique filename generation using UUID or timestamp - Proper error handling for invalid/corrupted images - Set file size limit at 10MB per image - Include API health check endpoint Development environment: - Python virtual environment (.venv) for dependency isolation - Local development on Windows with WSL2 - SQLite database for development (can upgrade to PostgreSQL later) - Run on localhost for testing Framework preference: Use Flask web framework for this project. Project setup requirements: - Create project folder structure - Set up Python virtual environment in .venv folder - Install Flask and required dependencies via pip - Use requirements.txt for dependency management - Simple development server setup (Flask built-in server is fine for now) This is a new greenfield project. Focus on getting a working prototype with proper virtual environment setup and clear folder structure."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Python/OpenCV applications upload images to the web service, and users can view these images and their metadata through a web interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Python client with an image, **When** the client sends an HTTP POST request with the image, **Then** the image is stored, metadata is saved, and a unique URL is generated.
2. **Given** a user accesses the web interface, **When** the page loads, **Then** a gallery of uploaded images is displayed with metadata and direct links.
3. **Given** a user views the gallery, **When** they sort by upload date, **Then** images are reordered with the newest first.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an invalid or corrupted image is uploaded? System should handle errors gracefully and reject the image.
- How does the system handle concurrent uploads from multiple Python clients? System must handle them without data corruption or performance degradation.
- What happens if an image exceeds the 10MB file size limit? System should reject the upload with an appropriate error message.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept HTTP POST requests from Python clients using CV2/OpenCV library.
- **FR-002**: System MUST store uploaded images in organized server folders with unique filenames.
- **FR-003**: System MUST save image metadata (filename, upload timestamp, file path, file size, image dimensions) to a database.
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate accessible URLs for each uploaded image that can be shared.
- **FR-005**: System MUST support common image formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, WEBP.
- **FR-006**: Web interface MUST display uploaded images in a responsive gallery/grid layout.
- **FR-007**: Web interface MUST show image metadata: upload time, filename, file size.
- **FR-008**: Web interface MUST provide direct links to view and download individual images.
- **FR-009**: Web interface MUST allow sorting images by upload date (newest first).
- **FR-010**: Web interface MUST have a simple, clean UI with mobile support.
- **FR-011**: System MUST include an API health check endpoint.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Image**: Represents an uploaded image with attributes like filename, upload timestamp, file path, file size, image dimensions, and URL.

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: Should there be any authentication or authorization for image uploads or viewing the web gallery? ‚Üí A: No authentication; public access for both uploads and viewing.

- Q: What are the target response times and throughput for concurrent image uploads? ‚Üí A: Response time: <2 seconds per upload; Throughput: 2 uploads/second.
