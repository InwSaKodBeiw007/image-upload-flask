# Implementation Plan: Image Upload Web Service

**Branch**: `001-build-an-image` | **Date**: 2025-10-01 | **Spec**: D:\image upload service\specs\001-build-an-image\spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-an-image/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Build an image upload web service that receives photos from Python/OpenCV applications and displays them through a web interface, focusing on a working prototype with Flask, SQLite, and local file storage.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+
**Primary Dependencies**: Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-CORS, Pillow, python-dotenv
**Storage**: SQLite (development), Local file system for images (uploads/YYYY-MM-DD/)
**Testing**: Python client testing, Manual browser testing, File storage/DB verification, Error handling checks
**Target Platform**: Windows with WSL2 (local development)
**Project Type**: Web application (backend + frontend)
**Performance Goals**: Response time: <2 seconds per upload; Throughput: 2 uploads/second.
**Constraints**: 10MB file size limit per image, localhost for testing, Flask built-in server for now.
**Scale/Scope**: Greenfield project, working prototype.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Code Quality**: Adherence to Flask best practices, application factory pattern, blueprint organization, environment-based configuration, clean virtual environment setup, clear folder structure, `werkzeug.utils.secure_filename()` for filename sanitization.
- **II. Testing Standards**: Test with Python client sending images, manual testing via browser, verify file storage and database entries, check error handling with invalid files.
- **III. User Experience Consistency**: Simple, clean UI with mobile support, responsive CSS Grid layout for gallery/grid display.
- **IV. Performance Requirements**: Handle concurrent uploads from multiple Python clients. Response time: <2 seconds per upload; Throughput: 2 uploads/second.
- **V. Simplicity & MVP First**: Focus on getting a working prototype with proper virtual environment setup and clear folder structure. Avoid over-engineering; use Flask built-in server and SQLite for development.

**Structure Decision**: Web application with Flask serving both backend API and frontend templates/static files. The `backend` directory will contain the Flask application, database, and uploaded images. The `frontend` directory will contain static assets (CSS/JS) and Jinja2 templates, all served by Flask.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - None

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   No research tasks needed as all unknowns are resolved.
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name: Image
   - Fields: id (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY), filename (TEXT), filepath (TEXT), url (TEXT), upload_timestamp (DATETIME), file_size (INTEGER), mime_type (TEXT), width (INTEGER), height (INTEGER)
   - Relationships: None (standalone entity)
   - Validation rules: File size limit (10MB), supported image formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, WEBP).
   - State transitions: None

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - POST /api/upload: Upload image (multipart/form-data)
   - GET /api/images: List images with pagination (?page=1&limit=20)
   - GET /api/images/<id>: Get image metadata
   - DELETE /api/images/<id>: Delete image
   - GET /health: Health check
   - GET /uploads/<date>/<filename>: Serve image files
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Primary User Story: Python/OpenCV applications upload images to the web service, and users can view these images and their metadata through a web interface.
   - Acceptance Scenario 1: Python client uploads image -> image stored, metadata saved, URL generated.
   - Acceptance Scenario 2: User accesses web interface -> gallery displayed with metadata and links.
   - Acceptance Scenario 3: User sorts gallery by upload date -> images reordered newest first.
   - Edge Case 1: Invalid/corrupted image upload -> graceful error handling, rejection.
   - Edge Case 2: Concurrent uploads -> handled without corruption/degradation.
   - Edge Case 3: Image exceeds 10MB -> rejection with error message.
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType gemini`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*
