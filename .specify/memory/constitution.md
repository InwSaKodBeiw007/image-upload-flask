# Image Upload Service Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
All code must adhere to established coding standards, style guides, and best practices to ensure readability, maintainability, and consistency.

### II. Testing Standards
Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests must be implemented for all features and bug fixes to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

### III. User Experience Consistency
The user interface and experience must be consistent across all features, following established design guidelines and accessibility standards.

### IV. Performance Requirements
All features must meet defined performance metrics, including response times, resource utilization, and scalability, to ensure a smooth user experience.

### V. Simplicity & MVP First
Prioritize building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to deliver core value quickly. Avoid over-engineering and unnecessary complexity; iterate and expand features incrementally.

## Development Guidelines

Adhere to the project's chosen technology stack and architectural patterns. All new dependencies must be approved and documented. Security best practices must be followed in all development phases.

## Workflow & Review

All code changes must go through a peer review process. Automated CI/CD pipelines must pass before merging. Documentation must be updated alongside code changes.

## Governance

This constitution ensures clarity, consistency, and alignment between the AI agent and the human developer throughout the lifecycle of the project.
Amendments to this constitution require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
